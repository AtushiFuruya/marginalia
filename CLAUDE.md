## Working with Assets

This repository contains only asset files with no build system or development tooling. When working with these assets:

1. All assets are located in the `HP素材集/` directory
2. Image formats are PNG (for transparency-enabled assets) and JPG (for backgrounds and photos)
3. File names use Japanese characters - ensure proper encoding support when scripting
4. Assets appear to be for a visual novel or similar narrative game project

## Notes

- This is an asset-only repository with no source code
- No version control history is present (not a git repository)
- Consider adding source code structure if this project expands to include HTML/JS/CSS or game engine code
