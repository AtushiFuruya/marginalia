# Slider Worklog Instructions

1. **Infinite Scroll Specification (initial brief)**
   - Recreate the Boys be Maid character slider with exact behavior.
   - Ensure truly infinite scrolling (Slide05 followed seamlessly by Slide01) with smooth animation and unchanged DOM.

2. **Image Replacement Requests**
   - Replace slider images with assets from `images/character_thumbnail`.
   - Later revisions required mapping each Latin name to its katakana equivalent and inserting the correct thumbnail for characters イレーヌ, クリスタ, マリィ, and ポーリン; display the katakana name, keep Japanese profile text.
   - Eventually requested sections for thumbnails 01–07, with placeholders (“Coming soon…”) for unfinished characters.
   - Final fix: ensure `Thumbnail_02_Christa.png` is used for クリスタ.

3. **Layout/Interaction Adjustments**
   - Maintain slider layout; avoid structural changes unless requested.
   - On mobile widths, prevent cards from enlarging excessively. Display two fixed-width cards per row, left-aligned when the last row has an odd count.

4. **Record-Keeping / OpenMemory Notes**
   - Unable to enable OpenMemory; asked instead to summarize work locally. This file captures all slider-related directives and changes discussed so far.
